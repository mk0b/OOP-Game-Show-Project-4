# OOP Game Show Project 4
 Megan Katherine O'Brien's OOP Game Show App Project 4 as a TeamTreehouse Full Stack JavaScript Talent Path student.


Grading note: Going for Exceeds Expectations but ok with Meets Expectations.


App Description:

This is a Object Oriented Program for a phrase guessing game.

The program takes a random phrase from a list of phrases and then displays it on the screen hidden from view. The user can click the onscreen keyboard with a mouse to guess letters in the phrase or use their keyboard.

If you have five guesses that are incorrect the game ends and the player loses.

If you find all letters in the phrase before your lives run out, the game ends and the player wins.


Styling Changes I made:

My color palette for the changes was insipired by Stardew Valley (game) colors.

- Changed the onscreen keyboard .chosen color to a different yellow.
- Changed the onscreen keyboard .show color to match the .chosen new yellow.
- Changed the onscreen keyboard .wrong color to a dark red with gray text to make it more clean you chose the wrong thing and it's now disabled.
- Changed color of the .header to a darker burt yellow to match the color palette.
- Change color of winning background (--color-win) to a darker green.
- Changed color of the losing background (--color-lose) to a darker red.
- Changed the .start background color of the overlay to a brighter color blue.
- I edited the hearts images in paint. I changed the regular hearts to a darker red and I created a black broken heart for the loss of life heart.
- Changed font to "Cabin" in sans-serif.
