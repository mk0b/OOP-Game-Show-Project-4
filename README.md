App Description:

This is a Object Oriented Program for a phrase guessing game.

The program takes a random phrase from a list of phrases and then displays it on the screen hidden from view. The user can click the onscreen keyboard with a mouse to guess letters in the phrase or use their keyboard.

If you have five guesses that are incorrect the game ends and the player loses.

If you find all letters in the phrase before your lives run out, the game ends and the player wins.
